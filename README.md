# Ordinary-Differential-Equation-Numerical-Solver
Solving Ordinary Differential Equation Numerically using 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method and can also be used to perform Integrations Numerically
### Recommendations:
* The preference would be to take independent variable x or t as x1, dependent variable y as x2 and so on.
* Solving higher order differential equations (Order>1) requires decomposition of higher order differential equations into several first order differential equations 
### Example:

<br />
<br /> This can be broken down into First order differential equations
